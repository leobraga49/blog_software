[Challenge Link](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-blog/)

This challenge is to build your own blogging software.

A blog (short for weblog) is a website that is intended to be regularly updated by its owner. These regular updates are typically written in an informal style or as a series of articles/tutorials documenting or explaining something.

Blogs became popular in the early 2000s as part of the move to Web 2.0 - when websites began to move from passive documents to participatory user-generated content.
